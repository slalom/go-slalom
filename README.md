# go-slalom

go-slalom is a tiny service made with [Go](https://golang.org) that showcases how to easily develop and deploy 
Go services in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

This repository and guides will help you 

- Setup [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
- Setup [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and install [go](https://golang.org) 
- Use [corba](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to create a CLI for your service
- Use [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev) to build and deploy your service
- Use [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com) to release your cli/service
