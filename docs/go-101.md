# go 101

Below is just enough to get you going in go. For full introduction go here https://tour.golang.org

- **package main**: Packages in go are similar to Java and other languages for structuring code. 
Executable commands must be in the `main` package.

- **func main()**: Functions in go are defined with `func` and like Java there needs to be a `main` function for an 
executable.

- **names**: Names of variables, functions, structs, interfaces, etc. that start with upper case are public. 
Otherwise are accessible only to the package they are declared.

- **struct**: A struct is collection of fields (data). A struct can have behavior with functions associated to it.

```go
type Rectangle struct {
    length, width int
}

func (r Rectangle) Area() int {
    return r.length * r.width
}

func main() {
    r1 := Rectangle{4, 3}
    fmt.Println("Rectangle is: ", r1)
    fmt.Println("Rectangle area is: ", r1.Area())
}
```

- **loops**: go only has `for` loops. They have an init statement, condition, and post statement like C/Java/etc. 
```go
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    sum += i
}
fmt.Println(sum)
```
[run the above code](https://play.golang.org/p/Yh8jRtIdbuT)


- **range**: for loops can also iterate over a `range`. A range can be an array/slice, map, etc. In the example below,
`i` is the index and `v` is the value.
```go
var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}

for i, v := range pow {
    fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
}
```

- **arrays and slices**: arrays in go are much like any other language and have a fixed size. In go you usually are
are dealing with `slices`, which are dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array

```go
// array
var array [5]int
// slice
var slice []int

// invalid!
// slice = array

// valid, create a slice
slice = array[:]
```
