# go 101

Below is just enough to get you going in go. For full introduction go here <https://tour.golang.org>

##### packages and package main
Packages in go are similar to Java and other languages for structuring code.
Executable commands must be in the `main` package.

```go
package main
```

##### func main()
Functions in go are defined with `func` and like Java there needs to be a `main` function for an
executable.

```go
func main() {
	name := "World"
	fmt.Println("Hello, " + name)
}
```
[run above code](https://play.golang.org/p/4SRGpQ_Z9Uv)

##### Variables
Variables can be declared with keywork `var`. They can also be inferrd through assignment using `:=`. A variable
can be reassigned a value using `=`.

Variables are scoped to innermost block `{}` they are declared, or to package if not in an enclosing block.

Names of package variables (as well as functions, structs, interfaces, etc.) that start with upper case are public. Otherwise are accessible only to the package they are declared.

```go
# var usage for declared type and assignment
var anotherName string
anotherName = "Earth"

# inferred type from assignement.
name := "World"

# use = to reassign
name = "world"
```


##### struct
A struct is collection of fields (data). A struct can have behavior with functions associated to it.

```go
type Rectangle struct {
    length, width int
}

func (r Rectangle) Area() int {
    return r.length * r.width
}

func main() {
    r1 := Rectangle{4, 3}
    fmt.Println("Rectangle is: ", r1)
    fmt.Println("Rectangle area is: ", r1.Area())
}
``` 
[run the above code](https://play.golang.org/p/g4Fs5OLa_ky)


##### loops
go only has `for` loops. They have an init statement, condition, and post statement like C/Java/etc. 
```go
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    sum += i
}
fmt.Println(sum)
```
[run the above code](https://play.golang.org/p/Yh8jRtIdbuT)


##### range
for loops can also iterate over a `range`. A range can be an array/slice, map, etc. In the example below,
`i` is the index and `v` is the value.
```go
var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}

for i, v := range pow {
    fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
}
```

##### arrays and slices
arrays in go are much like any other language and have a fixed size. In go you usually are
are dealing with `slices`, which are dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array

```go
// array
var array [5]int
// slice
var slice []int

// invalid!
// slice = array

// valid, create a slice
slice = array[:]
```
[run the above code](https://play.golang.org/p/3zibGSuL8tY)
