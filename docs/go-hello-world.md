# Go Hello World 

Create a working web app with the code below!

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

## Steps

- create the `hello.go` file
```bash
cat <<EOF > hello.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
EOF
```
- run the following command and leave console open
```bash
go run hello.go
```
- in browser go to (replace YOUR_NAME with your name) `http://localhost:8080/YOUR_NAME` or in separate console
```bash
open http://localhost:8080/$USER
```

## Awesomeness!

So what did you do? When you ran `go run hello.go`, go compiled hello.go, created a binary in a temporary folder, and ran it.

Alternatively you could build and run it with 
```bash
go build hello.go
./hello
```
In above, go compiled hello.go and created a binary in current path. You then can run it.

### compiled server

In many other languages you need to deploy your app to a web app server or "bundle" a server with your app. With go the  
server is built and compiled into your app.
