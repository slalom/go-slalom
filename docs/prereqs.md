# Pre-requisites 

Please make sure the following have been completed. These steps include the 
following setups:
- Docker Desktop
- Homebrew
- go
- (optional) Kubernetes Dashboard


### Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop includes Kubernetes. Use the appropriate link to download and install (links include installation instructions).

*macOS*

<https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac>

*windows*

<https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows>

Once Docker Desktop is installed, you need to explicitly enable Kubernetes support. Click the Docker icon in the status 
bar, go to “Preferences”, and on the “Kubernetes” tab check “Enable Kubernetes”

This will start kubernetes and install `kubectl`.  This might take a while, but the dialog will let you know once the 
Kubernetes cluster is ready.

brew install go
```
<!--
Create your go workspace

```bash
mkdir $HOME/go
``` 

Update PATH in your profile to include GOBIN
