# 1 minute Kubernetes 101

Below is the very basics you need for kubernetes. See <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/> for more info

##### container orchestration
Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. Or more precisely, it orchestrates pods. Applications are built from pods. And kubernetes efficiently manages
the lifetime, scaling, and networking of pods. 

##### pods, deployments, and services
Pods, deployments, and services are the basics you need to know when deploying to kubernetes. These are configured in 
yaml or json and applied to kubernetes. Here is an example of a Deployment definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: go-slalom
  labels:
    app: go-slalom
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
     app: go-slalom
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: go-slalom
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: go-slalom
        image: go-slalom
        command:
          - go-slalom
          - start
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP

```

- **pod**: A pod is a group of 1 or more containers. Usually it's a single container and configures the image used to run 
that container. You can directly deploy pod definition to kubernetes, but usually you will define a deployment.

- **service**: A service is a selection of like pods. It abstracts how the pods, and thus your application, are 
accessed (either in the cluster or from outside). While pods may live and die, the service persists until you destroy it. 

- **deployments**: Group identical pods and define their lifecycle and scaling. Killing, restarting, update strategies, etc

#####  kubectl

kubectl is the cli you will frequently use to manage applications in kubernetes. However, you can also manage applications
 in a kubernetes dashboard.
